The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn\\'t put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war.

We didn\\'t find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.\",\"reviews.title\":\"Excellent hotel with good access to Venice\",\"reviews.userCity\":null,\"reviews.username\":\"Simon\",\"reviews.userProvince\":null},{\"address\":\"Riviera San Nicol 11\\\\/a\",\"categories\":\"Hotels\",\"city\":\"Mableton\",\"country\":\"US\",\"latitude\":45.421611,\"longitude\":12.376187,\"name\":\"Hotel Russo Palace\",\"postalCode\":\"30126\",\"province\":\"GA\",\"reviews.date\":\"2015-04-06T00:00:00Z\",\"reviews.dateAdded\":\"2016-10-24T00:00:25Z\",\"reviews.doRecommend\":null,\"reviews.id\":null,\"reviews.rating\":4.0,\"reviews.text\":\"Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern.

Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle.

Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids\\\\/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel.

The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door.

The little doily that I'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, I'm sure was there for some time...I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! I'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (I'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload.

Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war.

In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money.

Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich.

Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus.

What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described.

And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay.
